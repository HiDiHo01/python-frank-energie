# Repository skills

Apply these practices alongside [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and [`AI_POLICY.md`](AI_POLICY.md). Update a practice when new evidence changes how to carry it out.

## Address pull request feedback

1. Record the current PR head and base. Fetch all pages of inline review threads and check their resolved state, including outdated threads. Read actionable findings in the conversation and review summaries.
2. Compare each finding with the current diff, tests, and API evidence. Open static analysis annotations even when the quality gate passes. If a finding points to older base code, check whether the current base already contains the fix before changing the PR.
3. Reproduce confirmed defects with sanitized data where possible. Verify the smallest fix with relevant checks, then link the commit and evidence when replying. Explain the disposition of invalid, duplicate, or obsolete findings before resolving the thread.
4. Check the current head after the final push and again after automated review. Verify the actual thread count, workflow jobs, and quality results for that commit. Distinguish a completed review from a skipped or rate limited review. Use a documented manual review trigger when supported and authorized.

## Handle partial GraphQL responses

- Use the exact GraphQL response path to identify a failed optional field. Verify that the operation supports partial recovery and that its required data is usable. The site-specific `me()` implementation proposed in PR #226 illustrates these checks in its [regression tests](https://github.com/HiDiHo01/python-frank-energie/blob/b3b0be752c0cff33c32c7e8511ca189e713cabbc/tests/test_me_partial_errors.py).
- Classify errors in their original order before using partial data. Preserve typed authentication, rate-limit, timeout, and validation failures. Keep malformed, unscoped, mixed, and required-field errors on the operation's normal error path.
- Preserve the successful sibling data and clear the failed optional subtree. Keep `None`, `False`, and a successful empty collection distinct. Validate optional boolean fields without coercing strings or numbers.
- Verify schema support before adding fields or compatibility retries. Test the actual query selection and arguments independently of mocked response data. Exercise the public method through mocked HTTP responses when testing request error handling.
- Keep HTTP exception mapping, GraphQL response handling, and model parsing focused. Check exception types, error order, and `Retry-After` handling after moving code between these layers.

## Keep diagnostic logs safe

- Use fixed diagnostics and safe metadata such as operation names, durations, and counts. Signal degraded results without logging raw payloads or upstream error details.
- Trace nested model parsers as well as the top-level method. Use synthetic account, invitation, site, and HVAC values in log assertions so successful parsing and privacy are both verified.
