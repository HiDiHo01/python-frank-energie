# This is a GitHub Actions workflow file that automates the process of running a Python script
# using Poetry for dependency management. The script is executed daily at 06:00 UTC and can also be triggered manually.
# It includes steps for checking out the repository, setting up Python, installing Poetry, configuring it,
# installing dependencies, and finally executing the specified Python script.
# The workflow is designed to run on the latest version of Ubuntu and uses caching for Poetry to speed up builds.
# The script being executed is located in the 'scripts' directory and is named 'query_script.py'.
# The workflow is triggered by a cron job and can also be manually triggered through the GitHub Actions interface.
# The workflow is defined in YAML format and includes a series of steps that are executed sequentially.
